# Custom Weapons
#### A plugin that allows you to load custom weapons in Little Witch Nobeta and switch between them at runtime.

# [Instructions on installing/using the plugin or creating your own weapons](https://nobeta.moe/Weapons)

## Developing

The project expects you to set the environment variable `NOBETA_PATH` to the install folder of the game, and that it already has [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx#readme) installed.

This source is not complete for creating releases, as the full source includes the `Dynamic Bone` paid Unity asset. You will need to obtain it yourself and place the required scripts in `\Custom Weapons\DynamicBones`
